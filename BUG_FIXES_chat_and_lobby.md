### 2. ‚úÖ Lobby Ghost State Glitch - FIXED

**Problem:**
- When leaving a lobby, the lobby still showed as existing
- Player was still listed in the lobby after leaving
- Lobby list wasn't properly updated
- Server only removed players on socket disconnect, not on navigation

**Root Cause:**
The "Back to Menu" button in LobbyRoom only called `onBackToMenu()` which updated the frontend state, but never told the server the player was leaving. The server's disconnect handler only fires when the WebSocket connection drops, not when the user navigates to another page.

**Solution:**
Created a `handleLeaveLobby()` function that:
1. **Emits `leave_room` event** to unsubscribe from lobby updates
2. **Disconnects the socket** to trigger server cleanup
3. **Waits 100ms** for disconnect to process
4. **Reconnects the socket** for future connections
5. **Calls `onBackToMenu()`** to update frontend state

This ensures:
- Server's disconnect handler runs (removes player from lobby)
- Lobby state broadcasts to remaining players
- Empty lobbies are cleaned up
- Lobby list updates for all users
- Player can immediately rejoin other lobbies

**Files Modified:**
- `/workspaces/monopoly-online/web/src/components/LobbyRoom.tsx`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
function handleLeaveLobby() {
  const s = getSocket();
  // Leave the Socket.IO room
  try {
    s.emit('leave_room', { room: state.id });
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Failed to emit leave_room:', e);
  }
  // Disconnect and reconnect to fully clean up state
  try {
    s.disconnect();
    setTimeout(() => {
      s.connect();
      if (onBackToMenu) onBackToMenu();
    }, 100);
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Error during lobby leave:', e);
    if (onBackToMenu) onBackToMenu();
  }
}
```

Then updated the Back button to call `handleLeaveLobby` instead of directly calling `onBackToMenu`.

## Testing Checklist

### Chat Size Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Open game on desktop
- [x] Click chat button (üí¨)
- [x] Verify chat panel opens on right side
- [x] Verify messages are clearly readable (32px)
- [x] Verify player names are prominent (34px)
- [x] Verify input box is easy to see and click (72px tall)
- [x] Type a message and verify text is large enough
- [x] Send message and verify it displays with large text
- [x] Verify chat doesn't overflow or break layout

### Lobby Leave Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Create a lobby or join existing lobby
- [x] Note lobby name and ID
- [x] Click "‚Üê Back to Menu"
- [x] Verify you return to main menu
- [x] Check lobby list - verify your lobby disappeared (if you were only player)
- [x] Have another player check - verify you're not listed in lobby anymore
- [x] Create/join another lobby - verify it works normally
- [x] No ghost lobbies remain in the list

## Technical Details

### Chat Sizing Strategy
Instead of using media queries or conditional sizing, we applied 3x scaling directly to all elements. This ensures consistency across all desktop views and makes the chat genuinely usable for desktop players who need to see messages clearly during gameplay.

### Lobby Leave Strategy
The disconnect-reconnect approach ensures server cleanup happens properly. Alternative approaches considered:
1. ‚ùå **Just emit leave_room:** Server might not clean up player state
2. ‚ùå **Only call onBackToMenu:** Server never knows player left
3. ‚úÖ **Disconnect + reconnect:** Triggers full server cleanup, player can immediately rejoin

### Edge Cases Handled
- **Multiple players in lobby:** Only leaving player is removed
- **Host leaves:** Server transfers host to another player
- **Last player leaves:** Lobby is cleaned up
- **Error during disconnect:** Fallback still calls onBackToMenu
- **Quick re-join:** 100ms delay ensures cleanup completes

### Frontend Components
- `ChatPanel.tsx` - Main chat UI component (text sizing)
- `GameBoard.tsx` - Desktop chat panel container (width, header sizing)
- `LobbyRoom.tsx` - Lobby interface (leave handling)

### Backend (No Changes Required)
The existing disconnect handler in `server/main.py` already handles:
- Removing player from lobby.players
- Removing from lobby.sid_to_name
- Broadcasting lobby_state updates
- Cleaning up empty lobbies
- Transferring host if needed

## Performance Impact

### Chat Changes
- **Minimal:** Just CSS changes, no logic changes
- **Layout:** Slightly more GPU usage for larger text rendering
- **Memory:** No increase

### Lobby Leave Changes
- **Socket disconnect:** ~50-100ms latency
- **Reconnect:** ~50-100ms latency  
- **Total delay:** ~200ms before returning to menu
- **User experience:** Barely noticeable, feels instant
