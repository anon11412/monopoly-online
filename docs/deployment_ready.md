### 🎯 Key Improvements in This Release

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **State Desynchronization**: Fixed end turn not broadcasting to all clients

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Single Container**: Frontend built and served as static files from backend
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Socket.IO with Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers
- **Frontend**: React/Vite built to `/app/static` in container
- **Same-origin**: No CORS issues, everything served from port 8000

### 🎮 Ready for Production
This version is thoroughly tested and ready for Render deployment. The auto-deploy should trigger automatically from the main branch push.

**Deployment URL**: Your Render service will build and deploy this version automatically.

**Test endpoints after deployment**:
- `GET /board_meta` - Health check (should return board configuration)
- `GET /` - Frontend application
- `WebSocket /` - Real-time game communication

All critical functionality has been tested and verified working locally.
