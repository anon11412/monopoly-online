### 🎮 Ready for Production
This version is thoroughly tested and ready for Render deployment. The auto-deploy should trigger automatically from the main branch push.

**Deployment URL**: Your Render service will build and deploy this version automatically.

**Test endpoints after deployment**:
- `GET /board_meta` - Health check (should return board configuration)
- `GET /` - Frontend application
- `WebSocket /` - Real-time game communication

All critical functionality has been tested and verified working locally.
